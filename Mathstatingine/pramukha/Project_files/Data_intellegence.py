                            Data processing Intelligence development unit 
            Making Data processing Engine that could handel enoromous data for visualisations and insights 
Problem 
1. Handelling Large dataset and extracting relevent informations out of it 
2. Underlining mathematical relations of Dataset and statistical inferentials 
3. Making basic prediction model for the dataset - Custom modeling unit 

Data Handleing intelligence 
    Batch based operations Based on Data complications and dimensions required 
    > Statistical inferential using Distribution modeling extracts - Statistical Data_insights 
    > Mathematical Processing : Making vectoric repressions | Making orthogonal projection based downsampling 
Core of processing || Preserving data insights and making simplicity of dataset for visual understanding
