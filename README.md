Project Development documentation

Problem solving :
    Making statistical insights : Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis 
    Understanding Mathematical relations of data and drawing Regression model for predictions 


                Execution Flow 
Dataset > Preprocessing dataset - Main data set handeling unit
            ~ cleanning (irrelevents, extream repetitive, strange), remoivng outliers, 
            ~ Formating Dataset for good data structure flow into system | good structural representations 
        
Classification unit
    1. Complexity [Variables | connections(based on linear , quadratic , cubic) | variability (variatibilty) - initiating astract extraction process ]
    2. Size (defining Computations) if bigger data then chunk based optimisations 
    3. Nature | Discreet/continuous data 

Situations 
> simple dataset with minimals direct plot fit and presentations -> Mathematical insights of relations 
> simple but complex data ( exception of the project)
> Big dataset with simple structure and connections -> plotfit and connected dataset matrix based operations | Batch based insights made data for final plot and math insights 
> Big data and complex(consisting high order relations/multi dimensional(more variables)/big size with more variability) -> Batch based computations for preprocessing -> batch based integration of model fits and insights for final math engine -> orthogonal projections and final plot with insights

Project data-flow structure 



----------------------------------------

Problems 
1. Classification of dataset into discreet and continuous 
2. Size and complexity of dataset based inspection being complicated
3. Distribution of the dataset basis on the basis of key-points in dataset 
4. What to model form the dataset any focussed condition | Making fit to the dataset itself
    > Based on what is the condition of probability set on the dataset we could model the situation into different modeling distribution set 

Algorithms  
1. Model fit Algorithms
    Procedure :
        Making basic model parameter transformations mechanism for retriving the results
        Testing different sollution set of equation matrix formed by distribution-data_point variations 
        sollution set with least variance is decleared as the modeling set of parameters 


--------------------------------------
Distributional Modeling expressions 
    DISCREET DATASET BASED 
    ~ Making direct emperical statements based on the dataset and what user want , making theoretical framework for predictions 
    making out the dataset comparision with the fits to get the actual framework,

    Distributions analysis sheet 
    1. Binomial distribution 
        > Does success and failiurs are their - Automated
        > Based on user what event he do have to compute 
        ~ Discriptive distribution about perticular events 
    2. Geometric distribution 
        ~ User based output about whats probability of an event to take place with some trials we do 
    3. Hypergeometric distribution 
        ~ Making user based output for probability of the event happening in all possibilities 

    Procedure 
    Make inspection of dataset for the distributions basis 
        - Binomial : 2 class dataset / user defined condition 
        - (Hypergeometric+Geometric) : Targeted event based > plots based on event 
        - Poission distribution :Probability of number of time a event happen in a chunk of dataset
